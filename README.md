# Malware Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to detect malware through network traffic analysis using a Random Forest classifier. The dataset used includes various features of network traffic such as protocol type, service, and flag status.

## Dataset
The dataset, `Train_data02.csv`, contains network traffic data with features that are preprocessed to train a machine learning model for classifying normal and malicious traffic.

## Features
- `protocol_type`
- `service`
- `flag`
- `src_bytes`
- `dst_bytes`
- `count`
- `same_srv_rate`
- `diff_srv_rate`
- `dst_host_srv_count`
- `dst_host_same_srv_rate`
- `class` (target variable)

## Preprocessing
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Convert categorical variables (`protocol_type`, `service`, `flag`) into numerical format.
- **Train-Test Split:** The data is split into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio.
- **Threshold Replacement:** Replace infrequent categories in `service` and `flag` with a common label.

## Model
A Random Forest classifier is used to train the model on the preprocessed data.
